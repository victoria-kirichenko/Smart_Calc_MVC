  <h1>Smart_Calculator</h1>
  <h2>About programm</h2>

  <p>The program is implemented in the Qt Creator IDE. The calculator has the ability to calculate basic and
    trigonometric functions, build a graph, use of variable "x" and credit calculator.</p>
  <h2>How to start</h2>
  <p>To start using the calculator, you need to install it using the make install command. this command will install the
    program on the desktop in the SmartCalc folder.</p>
  <h2>The rules</h2>
  <p> 1. If you have x in the expression, enter it on the line below. </p>

  </p> 2. When you enter "x" in the expression and press the "graph" button, a new window will open where you can plot
  the
  graph. You can choose the range (X min, X max) and the interval of axes (-X; X) and (-Y; Y) by entering a positive
  number X and Y for them. Use the "Draw" button to draw a graph. </p>

  </p> 3. Since the calculator is smart it will not let you enter incorrect combinations in most cases. For example:
  2--3,
  sin(+), etc. </p>

  </p> 4. To use "mod" or "^" in the right-hand part, you must explicitly specify the unary sign with brackets. For
  example: 102mod(-100) or 3^(-2). </p>

  </p> 5. If you enter an expression incorrectly, you will be asked to enter the expression again. In some cases, the
  calculator can tell you exactly what you have entered wrong.</p>
  <h2>Unistall</h2>
  <p>To remove the user program. Can use the make uninstall command</p>
